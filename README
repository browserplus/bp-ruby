Overview:

This will be the home of the next iteration of the BrowserPlus 
"RubyInterpreter" service: 
http://browserplus.yahoo.com/developer/services/?s=RubyInterpreter

This implementation will leverage the upcoming process separation in
BrowserPlus 2.2.0 to address some community requests, namely:

1. bp_require is silly, we should be able to require()
2. dependent services should be able to include native extensions
3. performance improvements (seek help to solve the "select problem")
4. upgrade to ruby 1.9.1 stable (better i18n support, etc, etc)
5. more built in extensions to the ruby environment
   (including the ability to use other services from a ruby service)
6. ability to ship byte compiled ruby for obfuscation
   (closed source code sucks, more for obfuscating api keys, and faster
    load times)
7. include why the lucky stiff's (in spirit at least) simplifications
   to writing ruby services

Build Notes:

external/ is where ruby will be fetched and built (and perhaps some
dependencies for important built-in libs).  the sourceball will be 
fetched as part of the build, and this will all happend 

Current State:

just gettin' started, focusing on mac first and porting over 
relavant bits of the old ruby interpreter.

License:

Everything here will be BSD licensed.

stay tuned,
