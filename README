Overview:

This will be the home of the next iteration of the BrowserPlus 
"RubyInterpreter" service: 
http://browserplus.yahoo.com/developer/services/?s=RubyInterpreter

This implementation will leverage the upcoming process separation in
BrowserPlus 2.2.0 to address some community requests, namely:

1. bp_require is silly, we should be able to require()
2. dependent services should be able to include native extensions
3. performance improvements (seek help to solve the "select problem")
4. upgrade to ruby 1.9.1 stable (better i18n support, etc, etc)
5. more built in extensions to the ruby environment
   (including the ability to use other services from a ruby service)
6. ability to ship byte compiled ruby for obfuscation
   (closed source code sucks, more for obfuscating api keys, and faster
    load times)
7. include why the lucky stiff's (in spirit at least) simplifications
   to writing ruby services

Current State:

just gettin' started, focusing on mac first and porting over 
relavant bits of the old ruby interpreter.

Build Notes:

external/ is where all external dependencies ruby will be
fetched, patched, and built.  You must first build external dependencies,
and then can build the BrowserPlus service.  Using the BrowserPlus SDK
you can run Ruby services from the command line, or install the service
locally and interact with them from the web.

Build & Test Prerequisites:

a) a recent version of ruby installed on your machine
b) cmake, version 2.6 or greater (see http://cmake.org)
c) a recent version of the BrowserPlus SDK
   (http://browserplus.yahoo.com/developer/service/sdk/)

After Checkout you must init submodules:
$ git submodule init

On OSX here's how to get started:
0. git submodule init
1. cd external/ruby && ./build.rb
   (this will download and build an embeddable ruby)
2. cd src
3. mkdir build
4. cmake ..
5. make

To run the interpreter with a sample service
<path_to_bpsdk>/bin/ServiceRunner -providerPath src/build/RubyInterpreter test/HelloWorld

Now you'll be in a command shell where you can interact with the
loaded ruby service
