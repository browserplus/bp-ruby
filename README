This will be the home of the next iteration of the BrowserPlus 
"RubyInterpreter" service: 
http://browserplus.yahoo.com/developer/services/?s=RubyInterpreter

This implementation will leverage the upcoming process separation in
BrowserPlus 2.1.15 to address some community requests, namely:

1. bp_require is silly, we should be able to require()
2. dependent services should be able to include native extensions
3. performance improvements (seek help to solve the "select problem")
4. upgrade to ruby 1.9.1 stable (better i18n support, etc, etc)
5. more built in extensions to the ruby environment
   (including the ability to use other services from a ruby service)

stay tuned,
lloyd
